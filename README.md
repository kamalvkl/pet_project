REST_UNIT_TEST.py functionality
You could think of it as a CLI version of POSTMAN :) Prime obejective of this script is to unit test the REST API responses.
TC_BRINGUP() -- This function takes care of the establishing RESTful connection handler to the orchesrator tool(DNAC in this case)
UNIT_TEST() --- User needs to provide the url, method type(GET/POST/PUT/DELETE), payload for the REST API to be processed
